# InfoGenie — Security & Guardrails

Foundational guardrails for production. See also `docs/capacity.md`.

## Modules (`services/security/`)

| Module | Role | Rollout flag |
|---|---|---|
| `headers.js` | CSP (report-only by default), nosniff, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, HSTS (prod) | `SECURITY_CSP_ENFORCE=1` to enforce CSP |
| `csrf.js` | Origin/Referer check on cookie-authenticated mutations | prod default `on`; set `SECURITY_CSRF=shadow\|off` |
| `rate_limit.js` | Sliding-window limiter; Redis when `REDIS_URL` set | always on for `/api/auth/{login,signup,request-reset}` |
| `prod_defaults.js` | Production-safe defaults for rollout flags | — |
| `secrets.js` | Timing-safe compare; `SESSION_SECRET` required in prod | boot-time |
| `password.js` | Min 10 chars + letter + number | signup / reset / invite |
| `validate.js` | Zod body/query/params helper for new routes | adopt per-route |

Permission / multitenant enforcement:

| Module | Role | Prod default |
|---|---|---|
| `services/tenants/permission_enforce.js` | RBAC matrix | `PERMISSION_ENFORCEMENT=on` |
| `services/tenants/context.js` | Tenant resolution | `MULTITENANT_ENFORCEMENT=on` |

## Recommended production env

```
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=<openssl rand -hex 32>
CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<openssl rand -base64 32>
INFOGENIE_API_KEY=<long random>
PERMISSION_ENFORCEMENT=on
MULTITENANT_ENFORCEMENT=on
SECURITY_CSRF=on
SECURITY_CSP_ENFORCE=1
REDIS_URL=redis://...
SENTRY_DSN=https://...
INFOGENIE_JOBS=1
```

In production, omitting the enforcement env vars still defaults them to `on`.
In development, defaults remain `shadow` / `off` / `shadow` so local work is unblocked.

## Observability

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/health` | Liveness |
| `GET /api/ready` | Readiness (Postgres required; Redis if configured) |

Structured JSON logs via `services/infra/logger.js` (`LOG_LEVEL=info|debug|warn|error`).

## Adoption checklist for new features

1. Put mutating routes behind session **or** Bearer API key (never rely on “same origin” alone).
2. Validate request bodies with `validate(schema)` from `services/security/validate.js`.
3. Scope reads/writes with `resolveTenantId` / `req.tenant`.
4. Map the route in `services/tenants/permission_matrix.js`.
5. Rate-limit any new **public** POST surface via `createRateLimiter`.
6. Never log secrets, tokens, or raw credential vault payloads.

## Meeting notes — outbound data flow (redaction deferred)

`POST /api/meeting-notes/summarize` still sends **up to 12,000 transcript characters
unredacted** to `api.openai.com`, together with the whitelisted contact fields
(`name`, `company`, `role` only — `email`, `phone` and free-text keys are dropped
before the prompt and before the row). No PII detection or masking runs on the
transcript body today, so a caller who pastes a call transcript containing names,
emails, phone numbers or account identifiers transmits them to the provider.

Pre-transmission transcript redaction is a **separate follow-up PR owned by
AI/LLM**; per-tenant AI rate/cost limiting is the PR after that. Neither is
implemented here.

At rest the same route is bound: the 500-character excerpt and the summary are
AES-256-GCM encrypted through `services/credentials/vault.js` with AAD
`meeting_notes_runs:tenant:<id>`, so a row lifted into another tenant fails the
GCM auth tag instead of decrypting. Excerpt material is NULLed 30 days after
write by the sweeper (`sweepExpiredExcerpts`, `UPDATE` only — history rows are
never deleted), and `generated_by` holds the numeric session user id, never an
email.

`contact` is narrowed at rest as well as on read. `backfillMeetingNotesEncryption()`
in `services/meeting_notes/schema.js` runs as a boot task, walks each tenant in
batches, and rewrites `contact` to the `{name, company, role}` whitelist — string
values only, each capped at 200 characters — so `email`, `phone` and free-text keys
written before the whitelist existed are removed from the row, not merely hidden.
The API narrows `contact` again on read (`_whitelistedContact` in `api.js`), so a row
the backfill has not reached yet still cannot surface `email` / `phone` through
`/api/meeting-notes/history` or the detail route.

Accepted residuals:

- A dev boot with no `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` writes the summary as plaintext
  JSONB. Production refuses to boot without the key, so this is dev-only.
- `transcript_sha256` is retained after the excerpt is purged (integrity /
  dedupe). It is a plain SHA-256, not a keyed HMAC.
- The contact backfill is the control of record for legacy rows at rest, so it
  must not stall: every row the backfill predicate selects has to be rewritten or
  explicitly skipped, or the per-tenant batch loop re-selects it and boot never
  finishes the sweep. Hardening the predicate against non-string and over-length
  values under the allowed keys, and against malformed (non-object) `summary`
  JSONB, is in-flight **Database** work — not claimed as landed here.
